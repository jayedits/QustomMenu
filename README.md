![GitHub Downloads (specific asset, all releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/jxnxsdev/QustomMenu/Qustom.Menu.qmod)


Customise the Beat Saber menu:

- Minecraft like Splash screen
- Custom Banners
- And more menu tweaks!

## Installation
Install the mod using the modding tools you used to mod Beat Saber, for example MBF.

## Custom Quotes
You can add custom quotes to the splash screen by adding them to the `quotes.txt` file in the `qustommenu` folder on your Quest.
It is located in `sdcard/ModData/com.beatgames.beatsaber/Mods/qustommenu`.
Each line in the file is a new quote.
Keep the quotes short, as they will be displayed on the splash screen. Long quotes can cause scaling issues.

## Custom Banners
You can add custom banners to the menu by adding them to the `Banners` folder in the `qustommenu` folder on your Quest.
It is located in `sdcard/ModData/com.beatgames.beatsaber/Mods/qustommenu`.
All images in the folder will be displayed as banners in the menu. Supported formats are `.png`, `.jpg`.
Banners can be found in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the `#banner` channel.

If you want to make your own banners, here is the template:

Same goes for `qpm s copy` and `qpm s qmod`
